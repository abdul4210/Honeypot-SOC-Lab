# Honeypot SOC Lab

In this project, I build a cloud-based lab using Microsoft Azure and Sentinel to demonstrate security monitoring, log collection, and threat analysis. I deploy a Windows 11 virtual machine, configure logging and network access, and forward security events into a log analytics workspace. Using KQL, I analyze authentication logs, enrich event data with geographic information, and visualize attack patterns through a world map.

### Lab Architecture and Overview
This lab is designed to be cloud-based and accessible from any computer. The lab provides actionable skills for your cybersecurity journey, with practical steps to enhance your resume and boost your job prospects. The Tenable Vulnerability Management cloud console was used as the main operating interface and the Tenable Scan Engine as well as the Scan Target were both hosted on Microsoft Azure virtual machines.
